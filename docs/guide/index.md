# Guide

This guide covers everything you need to build APIs with Apiwork — from installation to advanced features.

## Getting Started

New to Apiwork? Start here:

1. [Introduction](./introduction.md) — what Apiwork is and how it works
2. [Installation](./installation.md) — add Apiwork to your Rails app
3. [Core Concepts](./core-concepts.md) — how the pieces fit together
4. [Quick Start](./quick-start.md) — build a working API in minutes

## Core

Once you have the basics, explore each concept in depth:

- [Contracts](./contracts/) — define what requests accept and responses return
- [Representations](./representations/) — connect contracts to your ActiveRecord models
- [API Definitions](./api-definitions/) — declare resources, exports, and configuration
- [Adapters](./adapters/) — filtering, sorting, pagination, and nested writes
- [Types](./types/) — objects, unions, enums, and custom types
- [Errors](./errors/) — structured error handling across the boundary
- [Introspection](./introspection/) — inspect your API structure programmatically
- [Exports](./exports/) — generate OpenAPI, TypeScript, and Zod from your definitions
