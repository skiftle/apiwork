# Schemas

Bridge your models to contracts.

Schemas auto-generate contracts from your models — attributes, associations, filtering, sorting, and nested writes.

- [Introduction](./introduction.md) — What schemas are and when to use them
- [Inference](./inference.md) — How types are detected from your database and models
- [Attributes](./attributes.md) — Writable, filterable, sortable, and computed attributes
- [Associations](./associations.md) — Includes, nested writes, and polymorphic relations
- [Serialization](./serialization.md) — How schemas render responses
- [STI](./sti.md) — Single Table Inheritance with discriminated unions
- [Configuration](./configuration.md) — Per-schema adapter overrides
